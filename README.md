# 🌟 C Programming Practice Journey

Welcome to my **C Programming Practice Journey**!

This repository is a curated collection of exercises, challenges, and mini-projects that I'm working on as I explore and master the C programming language. It's a personal learning log — but also a resource for others who may be starting or revisiting C.

## 🚀  Goals

- Build a strong foundation in **C programming**
- Practice problem-solving using C
- Explore **advanced topics** and real-world applications
- Document learning through clean, well-commented code
- Share progress and help others learn along the way

## Current Status
🚧 **In Development** 🚧

## 📌 Topics Covered So Far

✅ Core C Programming Fundamentals:

- 🟢 **Basic Syntax & Structure**
- 🟢 **Data Types & Operators**
- 🟢 **Control Flow** (if, else, loops, switch)
- 🟢 **Functions & Scope**
- 🟢 **Arrays & Strings**
- 🟢 **Pointers & Memory Management**

## 📅 Upcoming Topics

I'm actively working on adding more advanced content:

- 🔸 **Advanced C Concepts** (function pointers, macros, etc.)
- 🔸 **Data Structures in C** (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees)
- 🔸 **Algorithms** (sorting, searching, recursion)
- 🔸 **Bit Manipulation Techniques**
- 🔸 **Multithreading & Concurrency**
- 🔸 **Standard C Libraries**
- 🔸 **Network Programming (Sockets, TCP/IP)**
- 🔸 **Embedded Systems & Low-level Programming**

Stay tuned — I update this repo regularly!

## 💡 Why Learn C?

> _“C is the mother of all modern programming languages.”_  
Learning C gives you deep insight into how software works at the hardware level. It's also widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, OS development, and performance-critical applications.

If you're interested in **programming close to the metal**, C is the language to learn.
